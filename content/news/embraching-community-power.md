    Welcome to NeoForge, where the strength of our community lies at the core of our success. Embracing the power of collective intelligence, we have cultivated a structured and inclusive proposal process called the "Idea Drive." This community-driven initiative empowers every NeoForged member to actively participate in shaping the future of NeoForge. From the inception of ideas on our dedicated Discord channel, [#brainstorming](https://discord.com/channels/313125603924639766/1105595318197825557), to the creation of tangible proofs of concepts (PoCs) published as Pull Requests (PRs) on GitHub, our process ensures that diverse perspectives and innovative solutions are celebrated.

    Maintainers, who transition from modders and users in earlier stages, act as guardians of the project's codebase in the PR review process. Their rigorous evaluation ensures that proposed changes meet the criteria of merit, implementation, maintainability, and requirements fulfillment. Additionally, the NeoForged community values long-term stability, holding backwards feature and functional compatibility in high regard. As we invite each member to engage actively in discussions and contribute their ideas, we unite in forging an extraordinary product that adapts to the dynamic needs of our vibrant and passionate community. NeoForge's future is shaped by the collective genius of its members, celebrating innovation and fostering a culture of collaboration.

# Embracing Community Power: Proposing Changes to NeoForge

NeoForge, owes its success not only to the developers and maintainers but also to the passionate and engaged NeoForged community. We believe that the power of collective intelligence is unparalleled, and that's why we are committed to fostering a culture where every member has a say in shaping the future of NeoForge. In this blog post, we will outline the structured process through which our community members can propose changes to NeoForge and actively contribute to its development.

## The NeoForge Community Idea Drive

### Step 1: [#brainstorming](https://discord.com/channels/313125603924639766/1105595318197825557) on Discord

The first step in the process involves sparking ideas and initiating discussions in the designated Discord channel, [#brainstorming](https://discord.com/channels/313125603924639766/1105595318197825557). Here, community members can freely propose and deliberate the general concepts of changes they wish to see in NeoForge. This open forum allows diverse perspectives to emerge and encourages a healthy exchange of ideas.

### Step 2: Targeted Discussion Threads

Once an idea gains traction in [#brainstorming](https://discord.com/channels/313125603924639766/1105595318197825557), moderators take the initiative to create targeted discussion threads. These threads are designed to guide and focus the community's efforts, helping to solidify and concretize the proposed ideas. Both maintainers and moderators participate in these threads in their personal capacity, providing valuable insights and guidance where necessary. However, their existence expresses no guarantee that an idea will be adopted. And the opinions expressed in those threads is of the people involved in their personal capacity as a modder, not as a NeoForged Organisation member, or even a maintainer. 

### Step 3: Developing Proofs of Concepts

The community's creative energy is unleashed in step three, where individuals or groups involved in the idea collaborate to create one or more proofs of concepts (PoCs). These PoCs serve as tangible demonstrations of how the suggested changes could be implemented in NeoForge. The PoCs showcase different approaches, fostering an environment of experimentation and innovation.

### Step 4: Publishing PoCs on GitHub

Once the PoCs are ready, they are published as Pull Requests (PRs) on our GitHub page. This step ensures that the proposed changes are transparent and accessible to all community members. By making these PRs public, we encourage further feedback and contributions from the wider NeoForged community.

### Step 5: Rigorous PR Review Process

The heart of our proposal process lies in step five, where the PRs undergo a thorough review. Our team of maintainers evaluates each PR on several criteria, including:

- Merit: How impactful and valuable the proposed change is to the overall NeoForge project.
- Contents: How well the PR addresses the identified issue and aligns with the project's goals.
- Implementation: The technical quality and feasibility of the proposed changes.
- Maintainability: Whether the changes adhere to NeoForge's coding standards and are easy to maintain in the long term.
- Fulfillment of Requirements: How well the PR meets the outlined requirements.

### Step 6: Consensus Building

To accept a change, consensus among maintainers is required. This ensures that decisions are reached collectively and are in the best interest of the NeoForged community as a whole. It may involve discussions, revisions, and constructive debates until a single Pull Request implementation is agreed upon. However, a unanimous decision is not need.


## Building a Solid Foundation: Key Insights into our Community-Driven Change Process
### Role of Maintainers:

Throughout the idea drive change process, it is essential to understand the distinct roles that maintainers play. In their capacity as modders and users of NeoForge, maintainers actively participate in the earlier steps of the process, including discussions and the creation of targeted discussion threads. Their involvement at this stage is as valuable community members who contribute ideas and insights.

However, from Step 5 onwards, maintainers transition into their role as gatekeepers of the project's codebase. At this point, they take on the responsibility of reviewing and evaluating the proposed Pull Requests (PRs) based on merit, implementation, maintainability, and fulfillment of requirements.

### Encouraging Thoughtful Consideration:

The NeoForged community places great emphasis on ensuring the longevity and stability of NeoForge. As such, we strongly encourage all community members to consider the implications of their proposed changes, especially during the Pull Request phase.

**Maintainability**: Proposed changes should be designed and implemented in a way that promotes maintainability. This involves adhering to coding standards, writing clean and well-documented code, and considering the long-term impact on the project's codebase.

**Backwards Compatibility**: While we do not mandate API/ABI backwards compatibility, we highly value backwards feature and functional compatibility. Pull Requests that risk breaking existing features or functionalities face a significant challenge in being merged into NeoForge. The community acknowledges that maintaining compatibility is vital to the satisfaction and trust of our user base.


## Unleashing the Power of the Community: Forging a Bright Future for NeoForge

At NeoForged, we firmly believe in harnessing the collective power of our community to shape the destiny of NeoForge. Our structured and inclusive proposal process ensures that every member's voice is heard, ideas are cultivated, and innovations are celebrated. We extend a warm invitation to all NeoForged members to actively engage in discussions, propose changes, and play a vital role in the growth and success of NeoForge. Together, we forge an extraordinary product that continuously evolves to meet the diverse needs of our vibrant and passionate community. Let's create a future that is driven by the collective genius of NeoForged!
